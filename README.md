### What I learned

Don't be affraid to start over with a different design. I originally tried to make this solution very "component" focused. However the differences between the two FAQ items and the embedded links and formatting make this difficult. I ended up re-doing some of the code with a more monolithic approach.

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

### Useful resources

<!--
- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
-->

Nothing at this time.
